# A.I.D — “Inform to Calm” (concept + very early prototype)

**Status:** concept + very early prototype (**non-production**).  
**Context:** Winner — Health Hackathon (6th Edition), Hospital da Luz | Learning Health (Oct 2025, Lisbon).  
**Goal:** reduce oncology misinformation and unsafe reliance on LLMs by guiding patients to *calm*, *inform*, and *direct* steps.

## Overview
- **Calm:** responsible messaging to reduce anxiety and avoid alarmist language.  
- **Inform:** curated, hospital-validated information (no hallucinations).  
- **Direct:** decision-tree triage to the appropriate specialty or to a pre-oncology/general-medicine consult when unclear.  
- **Plus:** suggestions of tailored questions to ask clinicians.
